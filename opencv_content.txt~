cvGet2D(img,i,j): takes the pixel ith, jth of image 
cvScalar it stores 4 values

cvmGet()
cvSetReal2D( mat, 2, 2, 0.5000 );


to do:
greyscale 
trackbar
make thee media and make the threshold values randomly
binary
vedio making


make a vedio player 
import vedio as told
create taskbar
use callback function to change vedio playing position as the trackbar is moved

// 2 functions which  will be required

erosion : remove the noise of black dot when it is surrounded by a lot of white pixel 

kernel is a matrix it will always a be an odd matrix 

we first dilatte and then erode

eroding making the size decreasing and dilattion increasing the size

edge is an abrab change in intensity

binarize : algoritm:
	convert it to grey and make blck and white

histogrmmic automatic binarize:

create image:
	we should get the size and point it to a variable

blobs:algoritm:
	use concept of queue
	go to a point and take all the point that are have similar value surrounding it
Canny:

Edge detection:



line detection:



vedio writer:

cvcanny : algorithm:
	let (x,y) is in the line y=mx+c 
	for a particluar (x,y) there are infinte (m,c) or (r,theta)
	make a 2D array with max (M,C) and check which value are most repeating


Shape detection:
